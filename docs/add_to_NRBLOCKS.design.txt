# maintaining a list of unique proteins in the NR.BLOCKS directory
# can be done with a simple set of shell commands
# 1. parse the md5s from the fasta files in NR.BLOCKS directory
# 2. sort the md5s obtained from the parse
# 3. verify the set of md5s are uniq
# 4. if md5s are unique, save as new list of unique proteins

inputs:
	location of NR.BLOCKS directory
	location of pre-existing list of uniq flex.md5s file
	location of new list of unique flex.md5s file
		(possibly unnecessary if pre-existing list is
		 correct)

# adding new proteins to the NR.BLOCKS directory
# can be done using the flex.md5.pl script on the command line
# flex.md5.pl infile.fa | cut -f1,3 | perl -lne 'my @a=split /\t/; die "$_" unless @a==2; print ">$a[0]\n$a[1]"' > infile.flex.md5.fa
# 
# 1. convert the protein fasta file deflines to contain only the
#    flex.md5
# 2. extract the sequence records for those sequence ids not found
#    in the list of unique proteins in the NR.BLOCKS directory  
#	extract_sequences_list -uv md5s.sorted < fasta.file
# 3. remove duplicate sequence records leaving one.
# 4. create chunks of size 100,000 protein records
#	sequence_chunker -n 100000 <prefix> <suffix> < fasta.file
# 5. create new list of unique proteins

inputs:
	location of protein fasta file to process
	location of pre-existing list of uniq flex.md5s file
	location of new list of unique flex.md5s file

naming conventions:
1) for the chunks in NR.BLOCKS
	prefix.chunk.suffix
	prefix describes where the data came from
	chunk is automatically created by chunker.
	suffix is .flex.md5.fa
